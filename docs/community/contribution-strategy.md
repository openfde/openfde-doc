#### 3.2.1 submit an issue/process an issue task{#commit-issues}

Your can clear [Feedback on Issues](https://gitee.com/openfde/problem-feedback/issues) to access the issue feedback repository for OpenFDE.

- **submit an issue**：Clicking on the "New issue" button allows you to create an issue and document the problem you want to raise.
- **process an issue**：If you are willing to handle one of the issues, you can assign the issue to yourself and set yourself as the assignee.
- **participate in discussions within an issue**：Under each issue, there may already be discussions and exchanges among participants. If you are interested, you can also share your opinions in the comment box.

#### 3.2.2 contribute codes{#commit-codes}

- **set up the development environment for OpenFDE**
  
  If you want to contribute to coding development and prepare the development environment for OpenFDE, please refer to [development environment preparation](./contributor/dev-environment)

- **get codes and pull branches**
  
  If you want to contribute code, it is important to understand how to download code from Gitee and merge code through pull requests. OpenFDE utilizes the Gitee code hosting platform. For detailed instructions, please refer to [Gitee Workflow Guide](https://gitee.com/openeuler/community/blob/master/zh/contributors/Gitee-workflow.md).

  The usage of Gitee is similar to GitHub. If you have prior experience with GitHub, you can have a general understanding of the content in this section and even skip it if you wish.

- **modify, build, and locally verificate**

  After making modifications on the local branch, proceed with building and locally verifying the changes. Please refer to [Building Software Packages](./contributor/build-software-packages) for detailed instructions.

- **submit a pull-request**

  When you submit a PR, it means that you have started contributing code to the community. Please refer to [OpenFDE Community PR Submission Guidelines](./contributor/commit-pr) for more information.

#### 3.2.3 contribute a software package{#commit-packages}

If you notice that OpenFDE is missing a software package, you can help by adding that package to OpenFDE. In fact, the process of contributing a software package is the process of enriching the functionality provided by OpenFDE.

OpenFDE supports automatically creating a corresponding repository on the OpenFDE in [Gitee](https://gitee.com/openfde) when a new software package is added on Gitee. This allows for automatic code compilation checks when submitting code to the created Gitee repository. For the specific process, please refer to [How to Add a New Software Package](./contributor/add-software-packages).

#### 3.2.4 contribute an original open-source project{#commit-projects}

If you want to contribute your own original open-source project to the OpenFDE community and become part of the OpenFDE distribution, you can consider the following methods:

- To develop in other communities and integrate it into OpenFDE, you simply need to follow [How to Add a New Software Package](./contributor/add-software-packages) and add the software to the OpenFDE repository.

#### 3.2.5 review codes{#review-codes}

OpenFDE is an open community, and we encourage everyone participating in the community to become active reviewers.

For contributors, to make your code more likely to be accepted, you need to:
  
- Prepare detailed commit messages.
- If the amount of code in a single commit is substantial, it is advisable to break down large changes into a series of logically smaller ones. Submitting them separately will make it easier for reviewers to understand your logic.

For reviewers, it is strongly recommended to abide by the [Code of Conduct](./behavior-rules), go beyond self-interest, respect each other, and promote collaboration. The focus of the review can be referred to as [Gentle Art of Patch Review](https://sage.thesharps.us/2014/09/01/the-gentle-art-of-patch-review/). During the review, you can focus on the following aspects:

- Whether the ideas behind the contribution are reasonable.
- Whether the architecture of the contribution is correct.
- Whether the contribution is complete.

#### 3.2.6 test{#test}

Testing is the responsibility of all contributors. For detailed guidelines, please refer to [Community Developer Testing Contribution Guide](./contributor/test-contribution-guides).

#### 3.2.7 documentation contribution{#doc-contribution}

You can contribute your technical articles to this community by following [Blog Contribution Guide](https://gitee.com/openfde/openfde-doc/blob/master/blog-guide.md) provided by OpenFDE.
