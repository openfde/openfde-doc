# Version 1.0.4 Changelog

## New Features

### Add network settings functionality

this version supports configuring networks on the Android desktop, including setting up wired and wireless WiFi networks on Linux.

- **configure Ethernet settings**

The default interface for configuring the wired network is "enaphyt4i0". You can choose to use DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) as the default configuration, or switch to manual configuration with a static IP address.

> **Attention**: The current updated version only supports setting the IP address for the wired network interface. It does not currently display the IP addresses that are already configured in the Linux network. We will improve this functionality in the next version.

- **configure WIFI**

If your computer is equipped with a wireless network card, you can connect to a new WiFi network here.

Once you successfully configure a wired or wireless WiFi network in the Android settings, the network settings in Linux will also be applied accordingly.

### Search for specific applications in the start menu

To help users quickly find their desired applications, a search bar has been added to the start menu. It allows users to search for target applications based on their names.

### Lock the OpenFDE screen

It adds a "Lock Screen" button to the power button icon located in the upper right corner of the Start Menu. Clicking the "Lock Screen" button will immediately take you to the login interface of OpenFDE. Once logged in, you can quickly re-enter OpenFDE.
